Hi! üëã I am currently pursuing an M.S. in Machine Learning at the University of Maryland, College Park, and am part of Prof. Tianyi Zhou's research lab. My research broadly encompasses machine learning with specific interests in computer vision, natural language processing, multimodal techniques, and generative AI. I am particularly passionate about building intelligent agents that leverage reasoning capabilities to effectively perform vision-related tasks and decision-making processes. Previously, I earned my B.Tech degree in Computer Science from Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology where I researched on applying computer vision techniques in healthcare, construction and urban analytics. 

I am actively seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2025 to further advance these research interests. I am open to collaborating‚Äîif my research interests and work resonate with you, feel free to reach out to discuss potential opportunities!

[CoSTA*: Cost-Sensitive Toolpath Agent for Multi-turn Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10613) [[**Project**](https://github.com/tianyi-lab/CoSTAR)<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>]

**Advait Gupta**, NandaKiran Velaga, Dang Nguyen, Tianyi Zhou

CoSTA* is a hybrid agent for multi-turn image editing that combines LLM-based reasoning with A* search for cost-efficient tool selection, balancing cost and quality. Unlike text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion and DALLE-3, which struggle with complex edits and retaining input image details, and agents like GenArtist, CLOVA, and VisProg, which perform poorly on multimodal, multi-step tasks, CoSTA* constructs an optimal toolpath using LLM-guided hierarchical planning and A* search. It dynamically adapts by refining tool effectiveness through real-time feedback from a VLM, ensuring robust and efficient execution.

# üöÄ Personal Projects
 
- [Emotion-Based Poem Generation with GPT-2](https://github.com/advaitgupta/Emotion-Based-Poem-Generation) üìÖ 2023.07
  - The Emotion-Based Poem Generation project fine-tunes GPT-2 to create poems that reflect user-specified emotions. Using a curated dataset labeled with emotions from the NRC Emotion Lexicon, the model generates text that aligns with both style and sentiment. By leveraging emotion prompts, it ensures the output resonates with the intended tone while allowing users to customize poem length.

- [Billboard Advertisement Recommendation System](https://github.com/advaitgupta/Billboard-Advertisement-Recommendation-System) üìÖ 2023.06
  - The Billboard Advertisement Recommendation System is a dynamic platform that selects ads based on real-time traffic and pedestrian demographics. Using computer vision, machine learning, and content-based filtering, it analyzes the audience to display relevant ads.
